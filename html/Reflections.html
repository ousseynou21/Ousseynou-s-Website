    <p>
Discrimination based on race and ethnicity takes many forms across the years. The United States has tried to get rid of this  for years but the way society works, being colored does not work in your favor most of the time.

    <p>I think the quote means that people should take time to understand each other instead of fighting. If people all always in the negative mindset and try to fight, the world will never be at peace and people will be seperated. It is important to remember that we are all human and should respect each other. If not the world will end in flames because of war.

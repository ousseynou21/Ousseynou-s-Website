  Computer System
</h1>
<p class="box1">
  A computer system is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, and store data and information. Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.

    Hardware
  </h1>
  <p class="box1">

    tools, machinery, and other durable equipment.
    </p>
    <h1 class="box">
      Software
    </h1>

    <p class="box1">
      the programs and other operating information used by a computer.

        Perihperal Hardware
      </h1>

      <p class="box1">
        A peripheral device is defined as a computer device, such as a keyboard or printer, that is not part of the essential computer (i.e., the memory and microprocessor). These auxiliary devices are intended to be connected to the computer and used.

        <h1 class="box">
          Input and Output
        </h1>
        <p class="box1">
          An input device sends information to a computer system for processing, and an output device reproduces or displays the results of that processing. Input devices only allow for input of data to a computer and output devices only receive the output of data from another device

          Case
        </h1>

        <p class="box1">
          an instance of a particular situation; an example of something occurring.
        </p>

          Motherboard and The Bus
        </h1>

        <p class="box1">
          The internal bus, also known as internal data bus, memory bus, system bus or Front-Side-Bus, connects all the internal components of a computer, such as CPU and memory, to the motherboard. Internal data buses are also referred to as a local bus, because they are intended to connect to local devices.
          </p>
<h1 class="box">
  Ports
</h1>

<p class="box1">
  a town or city with a harbor where ships load or unload, especially one where customs officers are stationed.
  </p>

  <h1 class="box">
    Processor
  </h1>

  <p class="box1">
a machine that processes something.
    </p>

<h1 class="box">
  Main Memory
</h1>
<p class="box1">
  Main memory refers to physical memory that is internal to the computer. The word main is used to distinguish it from external mass storage devices such as disk drives. Other terms used to mean main memory include RAM and primary storage. The computer can manipulate only data that is in main memory.
  </p>

<h1 class="box">
  Secondary Memory
</h1>

<p class="box1">
Secondary memory is where programs and data are kept on a long-term basis. Common secondary storage devices are the hard disk and optical disks. The hard disk has enormous storage capacity compared to main memory. The hard disk is usually contained inside the case of a computer.

    BOIS
  </h1>

  <p class="box1">
    a set of computer instructions in firmware which control input and output operations.
